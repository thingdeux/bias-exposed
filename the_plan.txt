    requirements: 
        Celery - For splitting off threads to do analysis
        RSS Reading library - Reading RSS Feeds
        BeautifulSoup - Parsing web pages


    Celery will split off threads and handle the processing of the data when the analysis is performed.
    Once the analysis is performed store the information in the DB and generate a slug for the story. Then Cache it.
    There should be no more than ~4 stories posted per day.
    Like words will be compared in one column .... opposite in another ... and outliers in yet another.





Basic Functionality Goal:    
    Scour a couple of big name news sites RSS feeds a couple times each day.
        Find the repeating political stories and/or stories that are big enough to persist for many hours.            
            Find the similarities and the differences in words used between sites.
            Use the A.P. and Reuters as a starting point to determine what the facts are.
            Find the outliers ... the words that were added to swing opinion one way or t'other.
