    requirements:
        Celery - For splitting off threads to do analysis
        Redis - back-end and result DB for celery
        Feedparser - Reading RSS Feeds
        BeautifulSoup - Parsing web pages
        *South - For handling Django DB Migrations ---- May just wait on Django 1.7 for deployment (any day now!)
        Numpy - Scientific computing
        nltk - Natural language processor

    Celery will split off threads and handle the processing of the data when the analysis is performed.    
    Once the analysis is performed store the information in the DB and generate a slug for the story. Then Cache it.
    There should be no more than ~4 stories posted per day.
    Like words will be compared in one column .... opposite in another ... and outliers in yet another.


Basic Functionality Goal:    
    Scour a couple of big name news sites RSS feeds twice a day (more than enough)
        Match articles using the rules below (see dev notes):            
            Find the similarities and the differences in words used between sites.            
            Find the outliers ... the words that may have been added to swing opinion one way or t'other.

django modules
    feed - Display/Storage of feeds    
    analyze - Language analysis and parsing


[Dev Notes]
Plan for finding the same story between sources. Matching will occur in 4 stages.

    [Each Match gets 4 points]
    Stage 1: Match like words from the title. 
    making sure to throw away common words like 'the' - 'and' - 'of' - etc.

    [Each Match gets 10 points]
    Stage 2: Exact quote match - Find the quotes from the story (text between "") and try matching them.
    
    [Each Match gets 6 points]
    Stage 3: Match exact sentences

    [Each Match gets 3 points]
    Stage 4: Token word match on the body of the story for the most recurring words.


[Natural language processing]
    (These will not be stored in the repo)
    [Natural-Language Corpus' used]
        stopwords - common english language words that should be filtered out (ex: if / that / between / in)
        wordnet - http://www.nltk.org/howto/wordnet.html (used for finding synonyms)


Some things to try:
    Lexical_Diversity (How many different words is the article using ... ie: Is the vocabulary broad or not)        

[DOM Discovery]
    Feeds will keep a table of DOM ID's for article body text.
    If an ID is no longer valid the feed will be flagged and not used until I correct it.
